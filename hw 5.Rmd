# The ARIMA model shows that there is no trend and accounts for short-term dependencies, forecast errors, and seasonality. The MA term is .1887 which shows that the model is adjusting based on past errors. The seasonal AR is 2 which shows that the model uses the past 2 values in the series. The best ARIMA model is (2,1,2)(0,0,1)[12] which means that the model uses past values, the data is non-stationary so we take the first difference, the model has 2 lagged error terms which means past forecast errors influence the future values. The seasonal components show that there is 0 past seasonal lags which shows it has no seasonal AR, the model did not require seasonal differencing, but the model has 1 seasonal MA term which takes into account the error from the one year ago, and the [12] suggests that there is annual seasonality meaning that the gold prices must follow a 1 year cycle. The sigma is really high showing that there can be a big error variance in the dataset.
