#We can see that lowest value is 23.72 and the highest value is 136.09. In the 1st quartile, 25% if values are below 63.95 and in the 3rd quartile, 75% of the values are below 108.98. The median is 85.88 and the mean is 84.85 which means that there might be some lower values that are dragging the average down.

#Q1 = 6.784749, Q2 = -7.969292, Q3 = -4.717247, Q4 = 5.901790
#Q2 is the lowest and Q1 is the highest 
#I think that Q1 is always the highest because many people will travel to Australia during the first quarter of the year because prices are usually cheaper and the weather is better. The second quarter might be the lowest because its Christmas time and people will travel to be with their families more than going out for vacation.

In the Normal Model, the residuals fall inside the blue lines which show that they behave like white noise and the model is appropriate.

# The Holt-Winters forecast is very good and more accurate than the other models because compared to the ets_model, HoltWinters has a lower ME, MPE and MAPE. The ETS model has a lower RMSE and MAE. Both RMSE and MAE are very close to each other in both models, but Holt-Winters has -.54 Mean Error which proves that this model is more accurate than the the ETS model. This model measures data for the next year and it predicts that the values will go up and then dip down and then rise up again. The ETS model predicts a similar forecast with slightly bigger numbers.
